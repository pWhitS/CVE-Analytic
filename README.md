Analyzing and Predicting Software Vulnerability Trends


Initial Results

We looked at the effect of memory corruption exploit mitigations, specifically DEP and ASLR on various system.

Our technique was to look at the ’acceleration rate’ in reported vulnerabilities. The total number of vulnerabilities reported is always increase, so we believed it was not a good assumption to look at increased reported as a indicator of exploit mitigation effectiveness. Rather, we looked at the number of occurrences where the acceleration rate of reporting either increased or decreased, for the introduction of an exploit mitigation on various systems. 

The overall results were murky and trends were difficult to distinguish. We believe their may be a trend away from ‘Memory Corruption’, ‘Buffer Overflow’, and ’Heap Overflow’ attacks for the first 6 months after a mitigations introduction. And a trend towards more web based exploits, such as ‘Cross-site Scripting’ and ‘SQL Injection’. After 15 month, all trends seem to stabilize. Our result match well with intuition, but confirming the results will require more work.
